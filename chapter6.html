                 <br> Float: Refers to numeric data that might contain values other than whole numbers, probably stored in floating-point notation. Operations performed on data of type float are similar to those performed on data of type integer. <br>
                 <br> String: Surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. They are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
