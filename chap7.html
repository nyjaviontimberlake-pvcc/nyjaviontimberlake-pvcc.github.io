        <br> <h3> Chapter 7: Software Engineering </h3><br> 
        
        <h3> Software Engineering: </h3> 
        <ul> 
            <li> A branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. </li>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Intergrated Development Enviroment (IBE):  </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Tools for developing software (editors, compilers, debugging tools, and so on) into a single, integrated package. Also provide simulators that, by means of graphical displays, allow a programmer to see how the software being developed would actually perform on a phone. </li>
        </ul><hr>

        
        <h3> Association of Computing Machinery (ACM): </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Purpose of ACM: Dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of computing, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open exchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards. </li><br>
            <li> Benefits of ACM membership: Provides the tools and resources to help get you there by advancing your career and enriching your knowledge with life-long learning resources. </li><br>
            <li> Student ACM membership: The option to subscribe to the full ACM Digital Library, Member pricing for Article Processing Charges (APCs) to make accepted full-length, peer reviewed articles in ACM, A full year (12 issues) online subscription to Communications of the ACM, and much more.  </li><br>
        </ul><hr>


        <h3> Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE): </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Purpose of IEEE: Is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.  </li><br>
            <li> Benefits of IEEE membership: Network with other technology professionals, establish a professional profile highlighting your accomplishment, join and participate in discussions on various technical interests, create a group to share and collaborate on projects, discover IEEE events and activities throughout the world </li><br> 
            <li> Student IEEE membership: None </li><br> 
        </ul><hr>

        
        <h3> Software Life Cycle - Development phase: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Requirements analysis: Is to specify what services the proposed system will provide, to identify any conditions (time constraints, security, and so on) on those services, and to define how the outside world will interact with the system.  </li><br>
            <li> Design: Involves creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system, developing a solution to the problem.  </li><br>
            <li> Implementation: Involves the actual writing of programs, creation of data files, and development of databases. </li><br>
            <li> Testing: Was essentially equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software requirements specification but is now recognized as only one segment in the overall struggle for quality assurance, which is an objective that permeates the entire software life cycle. </li><br> 
        </ul><hr>


        <h3> Modular Implementation: </h3> 
        <ul>
            <li> Approach used to design various products or applications – by breaking them down into separate or independent parts. </li>
        </ul>    
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Unifed Modeling Language (UML):  </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Offers a variety of tools for representing the internal object-oriented design of a system.</li>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Use Case: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Interactions between the system and its users  </li>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Use Case Diagram:  </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Attempts to capture the image of the proposed system from the user’s point of view. </li>
            
        </ul><hr>
        
        <h3> Data Relationships: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> One to One: Is exemplified by the association between patients and occupied private rooms in that each patient is associated with only one room and each room is associated with only one patient. </li><br>
            <li> One to Many: Is exemplified by the association between physicians and patients in that one physician is associated with many patients and each patient is associated with one (primary) physician. </li><br>
            <li> Many to Many: Would occur if we included consulting physicians in the physician-patient relationship. Then each physician could be associated with many patients and each patient could be associated with many physicians. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Design Pattern: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> A predeveloped model for solving a recurring problem in software design. </li>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Software quality assurance (SQA): </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Software development companies are establishing groups in charged with the task of approving the software requirements specification before the design stage began or approving the design and its related documents before implementation was initiated.  </li>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Software Testing:  </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Glass Box Testing: The software tester is aware of the interior structure of the software and uses this knowledge when designing the test. </li><br>
            <li> Black Box Testing: Tests that do not rely on knowledge of the software’s interior composition. In short, black-box testing is performed from the user’s point of view. </li><br>
            <li> Beta Testing: A preliminary version of the software is given to a segment of the intended audience with the goal of learning how the software performs in real-life situations before the final version of the product is solidified and released to the market. </li><br>
            <li> Alpha Testing: Similar to beta testing but performed at the developer’s site </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Documentation: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> User Documentation: Is to explain the features of the software and describe how to use them. It is intended to be read by the user of the software and is therefore expressed in the terminology of the application. </li><br>
            <li> System Documentation: Is to describe the software’s internal composition so that the software can be maintained later in its life cycle. A major component of system documentation is the source version of all the programs in the system. </li><br>
            <li> Technical Documentation: Is to describe how a software system should be installed and serviced (such as adjusting operating parameters, installing updates, and reporting problems back to the software’s developer). Technical documentation of software is analogous to the documentation provided to mechanics in the automobile industry. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Intellectual Property Law: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Software License: Is a legal agreement between the owner and user of a software product that grants the user certain permissions to use the product without transferring ownership rights to the intellectual property. </li><br>
            <li> Software Disclaimer: is the software developer's formal notice to the user of its software that the developer is denying any and all liability for any damages arising out of using the software as well as denying any implied warranties. </li><br>
            <li> Best Defense against software liability claims: Is to show that you exercised reasonable care in developing and testing the software. </li><br><br>
        </ul>
