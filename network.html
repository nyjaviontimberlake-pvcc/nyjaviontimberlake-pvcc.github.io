        <br> <h3> Chapter 4 Terms: </h3>
        
        
        <h3> Network Classifications: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> PAN (Personal Area Network): Normally used for short-range communications—typically less than a few meters—such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone, or between a wireless mouse and its PC.  </li><br>
            <li> LAN (Local Area Network): Normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex. For example, the computers on a university campus or those in a manufacturing plant might be connected by a LAN. </li><br>
            <li> MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community. </li><br>
            <li> WAN (Wide Area Network): Links machines over a greater distance—perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>


        <h3> Network Models: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Bus Network: Which the machines are all connected to a common communication line. </li><br>
            <li> Star Network: One machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected. </li><br> 
        </ul><hr>

        
        <h3> Protocols: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection) Ethernet: This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus which is not compatible with wireless star networks in which all machines communicate through a central AP. </li><br>
            <li> CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) Wifi:  </li><br>
        </ul><hr>


        <h3> Computer Networks: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Repeater: Is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals. </li><br>
            <li> Bridge: It connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection but it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side. </li><br>
            <li> Swtich: Is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two. </li><br>
            <li> Router: The connection between networks to form an internet provides links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics. </li><br>
            <li> Gateway: The “point” at which one network is linked to an internet serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.  </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Client/Server model: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> P2P (Peer to Peer): The client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-to-peer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis. </li><br>
            <li> Distributed System: Consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers. </li><br>
            <li> Cloud Computing: Describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.</li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Internet Addressing: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Tier 1: ISPs that consist of very high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs. These networks are thought of as the backbone of the Internet. They are typically operated by large companies that are in the communications business. </li><br>
            <li> Tier 2: ISPs that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business. </li><br>
            <li> Tier 3: An access ISP is essentially an independent Internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses.  </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> IP Adressing: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li a href="https://www.icann.org/"> ICANN: Is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet’s operation. </a></li><br>  
            <li> DNS: Used as an Internet-wide directory system, essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients "translates domain names to IP addresses.".</li><br>
            <li> TLD (Top-level Domain): Used to reflect the domain’s classification, TLDs include  for commercial institutions,  for U.S. government institutions,  for nonprofit organizations,  for military, etc.    </li><br>
            <li a href= "https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/"> Country code TLDS: Two-letter TLDs for each specific country, such as  for Australia and  for Canada.  </a></li><br>
        </ul><hr>
        
        <h3> Internet Protocols: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> FTP (File Transfer Protocol): An application for listing and copying files across the network implemented. </li><br>
            <li> SSH (Secure Shell): An application for accessing another computer from a great distance </li><br>
            <li> HTTP: Traditional network applications </li><br>
            <li> SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> World Wide Web: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> URL: Contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document. </li><br>
            <li> Client-side activities: The browser would use the information in a URL (perhaps obtained from the person using the browser) to contact the webserver controlling access to the page and ask that a copy of the page be transferred to it.  </li><br>
            <li> Server-side activities: Respond to client side by sending the text document from anchor tag from code to the browser </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Internet four-layer software: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Application layer: Responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the Internet infrastructure, may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible IP addresses. </li><br>
            <li> Transport layer: Is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet, also divides long messages into small segments, which are transmitted over the Internet one segment at a time . </li><br>
            <li> Network layer: In charge of maintaining the router’s forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets and which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet’s path through the Internet.  </li><br>
            <li> Link layer: Responsibility of transferring the packet. Thus, the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides and hands the packet up to its network layer. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Internet is:  </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Packet-switching network: Is a method of grouping data into packets that are transmitted over a digital network. </li><br>
            <li> Fault tolerant: The property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of one or more faults within some of its components. </li><br>
            <li> Redundant: A system design in which a component is duplicated so if it fails there will be a backup. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Cybersecurity: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Malware: Attacks that incorporate the use of malicious software. Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.> </li><br>
            <li> Virus: Software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine. </li><br>
            <li> Worm: An autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers. </li><br>
            <li> Trojan Horse: Program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim. </li><br>
            <li> Spyware: Software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack. </li><br>
            <li> Phishing: A technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it. </li><br>
            <li> DDoS Attack: A computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system. </li><br>
        </ul><hr>

        <h3> Protection: </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> Firewall: A primary prevention technique to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, a tool for terminating a denial of service attack because it provides a means of blocking traffic from the attacking computers. </li><br>
